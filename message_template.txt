Hi {name},<br><br>

I hope you're doing well! I’m reaching out to express my interest in the Frontend Software Engineer - Business Systems position at Verkada. The opportunity to contribute to the <b>largest cloud-based B2B physical security platform</b> and support developers in delivering <b>quality features efficiently</b> excites me. I’m particularly drawn to Verkada’s emphasis on <b>automation over operation</b> and the innovative tools-first approach.<br><br>

I’ve always admired Verkada’s mission and even applied for an internship position earlier in my career, although I wasn’t successful at the time. Since then, I’ve honed my skills and gained significant experience in <b>Frontend development</b> and <b>tools development</b>, and I’m confident that I can now contribute meaningfully to Verkada’s growth and success.<br><br>

With <b>over two years of Frontend Development experience</b>, I have worked extensively with <b>ReactJS</b>, <b>VueJS</b>, and <b>Typescript</b> to build scalable applications. I’ve also had hands-on experience with backend development, REST APIs, and custom tools for business teams, which aligns well with the requirements for this role. Additionally, during my master’s program, I honed my design skills and worked closely with both the design and development teams, giving me a holistic view of product creation.<br><br>

My ability to adapt quickly in <b>fast-paced startup environments</b> and my passion for creating intuitive, efficient tools would make me a great fit for Verkada’s mission. I would greatly appreciate it if you <b>could pass along my application to the person responsible</b> for this position.<br><br>

I’d love the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team.<br><br>

Best regards,<br>
